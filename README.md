#errorPort logo source
errorPort is a livecoding musical project too. This logo is about that.
It is nothing special. I've made my logo with implementing a maze-generator algorythm and modified it the following way:
- made letter "drawings" in letter.py
- prepared the maze with putting the letters into the blank, framed matrix
- the algorythm is adaptive to these prefilled values, so it worked well
